# ohmyzsh-key-bindings

This repository exports key bindings of [Oh My Zsh][1]
as a standalone zsh plugin that you can install using zplug, antigen/antibody or
with no bundler at all.

**Why?** I don't want to use the bulky Oh My Zsh for only a few features.

**Features:**

* history fuzzy finder
* go to beginning/end of line using `Home`/`End`
* move through command word-by-word using `Control-Right`/`Control-Left`
* some other tweaks _(TODO: finish README)_
